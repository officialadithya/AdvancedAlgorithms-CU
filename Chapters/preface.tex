To the interested reader,
\\
\\
This document is a compilation of lecture notes scribed during the Spring 2025 semester for CSCI6454: Advanced Algorithms at the University of Colorado Boulder. The content of these course notes is from lecture and several resources cited herein. I only take credit for the scribing of the content and lectures into the notes. This course was taught by Huck Bennett, Ph. D. and the notes would not be possible without Huck's great lectures.
\\
\\
I have taken liberties, deviating from the lecture notes, when it comes to notation and ordering of content between chapters.
\\
\\
This course is designed as a graduate third course in algorithms. Hence, we assume as prerequisites the topics covered in undergraduate algorithms and introductory graduate courses. At CU Boulder, the prerequisites correspond to CSCI 3104 and CSCI 5454.
\\
\\
While much effort has been put in to remove typos and mathematical errors, it is very likely that some errors, both small and large, are present. I take full responsibility for all remaining errors. If an error needs to be resolved, please contact me at \href{mailto:adithya@colorado.edu}{adithya@colorado.edu}.
